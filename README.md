# personalSite lessons

There are six versions of the personal Site. Each version implements new HTML tags, CSS styling, and web design principles, increasing in complexity and skill.

Each version has a README.md file to view and a txt.file to download with the lessons, steps, and the HTML/CSS skill being introduced.

In order to view each lesson, you can click on the branches to change which version you are looking at.

By looking at the commit history, you will be able to see what changes from the previous version lesson! Look for the "added boilerplate for version#" commit :)
