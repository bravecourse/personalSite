# personalSite lessons

Hello! This is a guide/answer key/lesson plan for the Brave Course personal site project!

There are six versions of the personal site project. Each version implements new HTML tags, CSS styling, and web design principles, increasing in complexity and skill.

Each version has a README.md file to view and a txt.file to download with the lessons, steps, and the HTML/CSS skill being introduced.

### View Version Code
In order to view each version and the lesson plan, you can click on the branches to change which version you are looking at.

By looking at the commit history, you will be able to see the changes from the previous version's lessons! Look for the "added boilerplate for version#" commit!

### View Version as a Web Page
In order to view the end result of the version/what the students will be working toward, download a zip file of the branch and open the index.html file with your browser.



Happy teaching :)
