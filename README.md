# personalSite lessons

Hello! This is a guide/answer key/lesson plan for the Brave Course personal site project!

There are six versions of the personal site project. Each version implements new HTML tags, CSS styling, and web design principles, increasing in complexity and skill.

- [version 1](https://github.com/bravecourse/personalSite/tree/version1)
- [version 2](https://github.com/bravecourse/personalSite/tree/version2)
- [version 3](https://github.com/bravecourse/personalSite/tree/version3)
- [version 4](https://github.com/bravecourse/personalSite/tree/version4)
- [version 5](https://github.com/bravecourse/personalSite/tree/version5)
- [version 6](https://github.com/bravecourse/personalSite/tree/version6)

Each version has a README.md file to view and a txt.file to download with the lessons, steps, and the HTML/CSS skill being introduced.
